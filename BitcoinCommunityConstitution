In reference to the final draft of the Bitcoin legislation https://bbblabs.org/~3448 to be enacted into law, kindly find here below our Bitcoin Community Constitution:

1> To hodl a value of Bitcoin that is at least the amount that can be personally dispensed.

2> To defend free and open Bitcoin markets anywhere and everywhere around the world.

3> To mine Bitcoin only with renewable energy, even if starting with just one miner.

4> To spread the knowledge, awareness and best practices of Bitcoin whenever possible.

5> To eventually consider with others in the community our unit of account in BTC.

May personal and communal self-sovereignty be best achieved through these best practices and through the use of the best money currently in existence.
